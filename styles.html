        <div><p>Mitsuki Frances Laycock, known professionally as Mitski, was born on September 27, 1990 in the Mie prefecture of Japan. Mitski was eighteen when she wrote her first song. Mitski's family settled in Turkey for some of the time she was in high school though she did not complete her senior year, explaining in an interview that “I realized I had all the credits needed to graduate...I went to the principal’s office and just asked for my degree. So I graduated early.”When she was around 16 and living in Japan, she was working with a pop idol manager who gave her songs geared towards creating a cute, J-pop image.</p></div>
