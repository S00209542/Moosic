                <article class="stylePar"> Joji's style is heavily alt and influenced by korean street fashion, which has become quite popular recently. Korean fashion refers to the wearing of larger oversized clothes which often uses pastel and bright vibrant colours mixed in with neutral colours. 
                    <br><br> Joji uses a small amount of accesories to not take away from his entire outfit and wears a light silver chain around his neck. His overcoat left slightly open accompanied with his neutral white T-shirt, highlights his jewellery.
                    <br><br>Although slightly hidden under his overcoat, Joji is adorned with aqua colored flannel pants which bring vibrancy and colour to his outfit. 
                    <br><br>Joji finishes his look with black leather Dr Martens which accompany this look quite well.</article>

                <article class="stylePar"> Mitski wears a black bralet which shows off her skin demonstrating that she is not afraid of showing off when she has to and that she is confident enough in her own skin to not go overboard with extravagency in her outfits.
                    <br><br>Mitski's style is very minimalist using dark tones and wearing wide legged in homage to 70's fashion and style of that time. Mitski also takes inspiration from Korean street fashion as she often wears baggy clothes such as her pants. 
                    <br><br>To finish off her look, Mitski wears black leather strap heels which also compliments the dark theme of her style quite well.</article>

                <article class="stylePar"> The outfit Jack wears could be seen as quite a simple look but it is still quite eye-catching and pleasant which matches his overall theme of all his work. The themes that are demonstrated in his outfit are quite early 90's nostalgiac VHS which is imitated in his art such as his short animations and music.
                    <br><br>The striped wooly beige jumper which he wears is the centerpiece of his whole outfit and coupled with his fair blonde hair almost completes his look without even looking at the rest of his outfit.
                    <br><br>Jack wears neutral denim jeans which almost gives him a rural workman look with this outfit.
                    <br><br>For his shoes, Jack wears generic black leather Dr Martens to complete his look.

                <article class="stylePar">Billie Eilish's style and look have always been quite iconic and have become part of her character as an artist. For this look Billie goes for an all lime green look.
                    <br><br>To start off this look Billie is wearing some square lime green sunglasses.
                    <br><br>Billie wears an oversized lime green hoodie from brand, "Murd333r.fm" which, sadly, cannot be purchased online. The vibrant text on the lime green jumper is highlighted as it is the only other colour in this entire outfit which is not lime green.
                    <br><br>For pants, Billie wears some lime green sweatpants which compliment the pastel lime green colour on the hem of the "Murd333r.fm" jumper.
                    <br><br>To finish off this vibrant look, Billie couples the rest of her lime green outfit with some leather neon green boots. This outfit definitely stands out and is meant to catch the eye.
